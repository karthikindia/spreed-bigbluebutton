# Nextcloud Talk using Big Blue Button 

This is a fork to use [Big Blue Button](https://bigbluebutton.org/) as the video / audio conferencing server instead of Nextcloud's PHP-based signalling engine (or the NextCloud paid cloud signaling servers)

## Rationale for the fork

Using PHP as a backend for conferencing is a bad idea for many reasons. It remains a good technical feat, but suffers from:
- Latency -- PHP does not maintain persistent connections with users and is an interpreted language
- Cannot maintain many connections at the same time (max is about 4-5 based on our own experience)

Paying for the third-party service by NC was not an option for us (maybe it is for you) -- it is too expensive for a solutions provider like us

## Why Big Blue Button

This is a tried-tested-and-true solutions used by many educational institutions worldwide. It has been under active development for a very long time and is well-maintained. Uses Red5 and Kurento under the hood, and has a very nice and solid client (using our beloved [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com))

- A recommended BBB server can support over 100 simultaneous users
- BBB client can handle a lot more participants in the UI
- BBB client has drawing board, breakout rooms, uploading PDF,DOC,PPT,XLS
- BBB client has realtime notes
- BBB client UI is professional-grade (no offense intended for current Talk client UI)

## How to setup BBB

Super easy, they have an [automated install script](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/install.html). You do need to have an SSL certificate setup (does it for you, but you need to setup your domains properly). Don't forget that you need Ubuntu 16

## What we did

We load up an iframe with your BBB server where the old Talk client was. That's it in a nutshell.
Right now it is still internally called **spreed** which is the original name of the Talk App. The reasons are many, but prevent us from pushing into the NC Apps store. If you can help with this, please open an issue.

We still kept the chat as-is (using the internal signaling server)

We also removed the changelog that appears for new users (I understand the rationale, but annoying for system administrators)

> The original code is very well-written. Kudos to the original developers. Made it easier to make changes. We had to add a few helper functions here and there as some needs were not served well by existing ones (e.g. get the name of a guest to send to BBB)

## How to use this plugin

### First you have to manually clone it in your /apps folder

Of course, remove the original spreed

`git clone git@github.com:ramezrafla/spreed-bigbluebutton.git spreed --branch stable18-bbb`

Notes: 
- We included the build dir in this repo. In the future we will add releases (help wanted) or push in the Apps store
- Supports NC 18 only -- sorry, too much work porting back

### Add your BBB server info in config/config.php

```
  'spreed' =>
  array (
    'bbb_server' => 'https://YOURSERVER/bigbluebutton/',
    'bbb_secret' => 'YOURSECRET',
  ),
```

Notes:
- The trailing slash is important in the URL above
- You can get both info from your BBB server: `sudo bbb-conf --secret`
- We need to add to the admin settings of the app the ability to edit these manually (help wanted)

### Test it

Reload your browser, clear your cache, etc. and you can now start calls with BBB

## TODO

Needless to say, help wanted

1. Allow iframe within the App
2. (Maybe) Use original internal signaling server in file-side video chat -- if not, we need to remove TURN / STUN from settings (maybe even external signaling server)
3. Add the 2 parameters in the admin settings (and change code to load app parameters)
4. Change name of this app 
5. Publish to apps store
6. Change the name of a guest (if possible) in BBB if a user changes it in this App -- haven't checked the API yet so not sure if feasible

If you need a BBB server for testing, please PM me.

## Please don't

1. Ask for help to setup your BBB server -- out of scope. If you are having issues read the docs or look for a third-party provider
2. Criticize this work needlessly -- it was done to serve a purpose (for example, we did not add the doc above the new functions, later ...)
3. Ask us to add your must-have features for you -- we are sharing this in the hopes that it is useful and welcome good PRs; so there is no reason you can't do it yourself or pay someone else

# Nextcloud Talk

**Video- & audio-conferencing app for Nextcloud**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/spreed/master/docs/call-in-action.png)

## Why is this so awesome?

* üí¨ **Chat integration!** Nextcloud Talk comes with a simple text chat. Allowing you to share files from your Nextcloud and mentioning other participants.
* üë• **Private, group, public and password protected calls!** Just invite somebody, a whole group or send a public link to invite to a call.
* üíª **Screen sharing!** Share your screen with participants of your call. You just need to use Firefox version 52 (or newer), latest Edge or Chrome 49 (or newer) with this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screensharing-for-nextclo/kepnpjhambipllfmgmbapncekcmabkol).
* üöÄ **Integration with other Nextcloud apps** like Files, Contacts and Deck. More to come.
* üôà **We‚Äôre not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [simpleWebRTC](https://simplewebrtc.com/) library.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/milestones/):
* üôã [Federated calls](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/21), to call people on other Nextclouds

If you have suggestions or problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues) or contribute directly :)

## Installing for Production

Nextcloud Talk is really easy to install. You just need to enable the app from the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed) and everything will work out of the box.

There are some scenarios (users behind strict firewalls / symmetric NATs) where a TURN server is needed. That's a bit more tricky installation, but the guys from [Nextcloud VM](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm) have developed a script which takes care of everything for you. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/apps/talk.sh). The script is tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04, but should work on 16.04 as well. Please keep in mind that it's developed for the VM specifically and any issues should be reported in that repo, not here.

Here's a short [video](https://youtu.be/KdTsWIy4eN0) on how it's done.

If you need to use Talk in a enterprise environment, including the ability to have calls with more than 5-6 users, you can contact our sales team for access to our [high performance back-end](https://nextcloud.com/talk/#pricing). This is a set of components that replaces some of the PHP code with a more scalable and performant solution that decreases network traffic and allows dozens or hundreds of users in a call.

## Development setup

1. Simply clone this repository into the `apps` folder of your Nextcloud development instance.
2. Run `make dev-setup` to install the dependencies;
3. Run `make build-js`
4. Then activate it through the apps management. :tada:
5. To build the docs locally, install mkdocs locally: `apt install mkdocs mkdocs-bootstrap`

We are also available on [our public Talk team conversation](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/call/c7fz9qpr), if you want to join the discussion.

### API documentation

The API documentation is available at https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Milestones and Branches

#### Branches

In the Talk app we have one branch per Nextcloud server version. stable* branches of the app should always work with the same branch of the Nextcloud server.
This is only off close to releases of the server, to allow easier finishing of features, so we don't have to backport them.

#### Milestones

* 5.0.0 - **Numeric** milestones are settled and waiting for their release or some final polishing
* üíô Next Minor (15) - The **next minor** milestone is for issues/PR that go into the next Dot-Release for the given Nextcloud version (in the example 15 - e.g. 5.0.1)
* üíö Next Major - The **next major** milestone is for issues/PR that go into the next feature release for the new Major Nextcloud version (as there are Minors for 15, this would be 16)
* üíõ Following Major - The **following major** milestone is for issues/PR that should be worked towards/on but didn't make it into the next major due to timing constraints
* üíî Backlog - The **backlog** milestone is assigned to all remaining issues

You can always pick a task of any of the milestones and we will help you to get it into the assigned milestone or also an earlier one if time permits. It's just a matter of having an overview and better visibility what we think should be worked on, but it's not exclusive.


### Useful tricks for testing

* Disable camera until reboot: `sudo modprobe -r uvcvideo`
* Re-enable camera: `sudo modprobe uvcvideo`
* Send fake-stream (audio and video) in firefox:
  1. Open `about:config`
  2. Search for `fake`
  3. Toggle `media.navigator.streams.fake` to **true**
